[Holi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi) is an auspisious full moon day 🌕 celebrated predominantly in India and other parts of the world that signifies the arrival of spring 😎 and the end of winter ❄ . Additionaly it serves to be an occasion for ushering love😍 , forgeting old differences ⚔ , forgiving each other 🙏 , reparing shattered connections 🔨 and most importantly meeting each other 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️ and spending a gala time together.

Popularly known as the __Festival of Colors__, a vital part of the celebration is characterized people smearing each other's face with dry powered colors called _abir_ or _gulal_. This can be also extended to a water fight where people use water guns(_pichkaris_) or colored water filled ballons against each other to end up like a canvas of colors while enjoying the entire activity in playfullness

## The motivation 

As popular and noble cause that Holi serves, it poses certain environmental concerns such as:
- wastage of huge amounts of water that could be used otherwise for sustaining life 🚫😒
- pollution of water bodies 🌊❗
- contanimation of the ecosystem 🦌🌼 involved 
- health issues due to hazardous chemicals💀 used in the powders 

So, it sprung upon that can we use deep learning to emulate how it would be for us to play Holi without actually having done so?💡

## So lets see what we can do: 🧠

We make use of the concept of **Photorealistic Image Style Transfer** 📸 here, which means to transfer the style of one image called the _style image_ to another image called the  _content image_ ,while making sure that the original structure and detail outline of the content image is intact as well as the resultant image resembles a real image that would have been shot by camera

While several methods have been proposed over the years, here we shall use [NVIDIA'S A Closed-form Solution to Photorealistic Image Stylization](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2018-09_A-Closed-form-Solution) for our purpose 🔥
