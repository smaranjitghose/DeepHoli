Holi is an auspisious full moon day 🌕 celebrated predominantly in India and other parts of the world that signifies the arrival of spring 😎 and the end of winter ❄ . Additionaly it serves to be an occasion for ushering love😍 , forgeting old differences ⚔ , forgiving each other 🙏 , reparing shattered connections 🔨 and most importantly meeting each other 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️ and spending a gala time together.


Popularly known as the __Festival of Colors__, a vital part of the celebration is characterized people smearing each other's face with dry powered colors called _abir_ or _gulal_. This can be also extended to a water fight where people use water guns(_pichkaris_) or colored water filled ballons against each other to end up like a canvas of colors while enjoying the entire activity in playfullness

## The motivation 

As popular and noble cause that Holi serves, it poses certain environmental concerns such as:
- wastage of huge amounts of water that could be used otherwise for sustaining life 🚫😒
- pollution of water bodies 🌊❗
- contanimation of the ecosystem 🦌🌼 involved 
- health issues due to hazardous chemicals💀 used in the powders 

So, it sprung upon that can we use deep learning to emulate how it would be for us to play Holi without actually having done so?💡
